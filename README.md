QtWaitingSpinner
================

QtWaitingSpinner is a highly configurable, custom Qt widget for showing "waiting" or "loading" spinner icons in Qt applications, e.g. the spinners below are all QtWaitingSpinner widgets differing only in their configuration:

### Configuration

The following properties can all be controlled directly through their corresponding setters:

* Color of the widget
* "Roundness" of the lines
* Speed (rotations per second)
* Number of lines to be drawn
* Line length
* Line width
* Radius of the spinner's "dead space" or inner circle
* The percentage fade of the "trail"
* The minimum opacity of the "trail"

### Usage

Despite being highly configurable, QtWaitingSpinner is extremely easy to use and, to make things even easier, the "QtWaitingSpinnerTest" application can assist you in determining the exact shape, size and color you'd like your spinner to have.

For example, the embedded spinner in the QtWaitingSpinnerTest screenshot below can be created as follows:

```
  from waitingspinnerwidget import QtWaitingSpinner

  spinner = QtWaitingSpinner(self)

  spinner.setRoundness(70.0)
  spinner.setMinimumTrailOpacity(15.0)
  spinner.setTrailFadePercentage(70.0)
  spinner.setNumberOfLines(12)  spinner.setLineLength(10)
  spinner.setLineWidth(5)
  spinner.setInnerRadius(10)
  spinner.setRevolutionsPerSecond(1)
  spinner.setColor(QColor(81, 4, 71))

  spinner.start(); // gets the show on the road!

```

As an alternative example, the code below will create a spinner that (1) blocks all user input to the main application for as long as the spinner is active, (2) automatically centers itself on its parent widget every time "start" is called and (3) makes use of the default shape, size and color settings.

```
	spinner = QtWaitingSpinner(self, True, True, Qt.ApplicationModal)
	spinner.start() // starts spinning
```

### Thanks
To @snowwlex for the base of my port (and this README).

QtWaitingSpinner was inspired by the [spin.js](http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/)  project.
